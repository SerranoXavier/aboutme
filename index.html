	<p>
		Hello, my name is Xavier Serrano. I am from France and currently living in Canada. I am married and have four children.
	</p>
	<p>
		I work in the Geographical Information Systems (GIS) field. More specificly, I am specialized in (geo)data manipulation and processing. I am pursuing an online BS degree at Brigham Young University - Idaho (BYU-I) in Web and software programming. My goal here is to explore new possibilities and enhance my carreer. Sofware programming has been something I wanted to do for a long time, and thanks to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints' education program I am now able to do it!

		Beside my work, I love to spend time with my family, playing around with my kids. I like to read, especially sci-fi and fantasy. I also like to hike in the mountains and photograph the beautiful landscapes. I will rarely say no to a boardgame night with friends. Finaly, traveling and discovering new places and cultures is wonderful to me.
